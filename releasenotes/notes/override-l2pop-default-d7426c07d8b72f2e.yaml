issues:
  - The default value for `neutron_l2_population` has been
    overridden, which will require deployers to recreate
    any VXLAN interfaces created with `neutron_l2_population`
    set `False`. Not recreating these interfaces will lead to
    connectivity issues for virtual machines.
upgrade:
  - Based on feedback from Support, the default value for
    `neutron_l2_population` has been overridden to `True`.
